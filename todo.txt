TODO:
  - File Transfer
    Work-flow:
    - Add File transfer view to list ongoing and complete file transfers
        v Get print user for grouping
        v Open folder with file
        v Add remove entry button
        v Update the list when state changes (file is transferred)
        v Get real data
        v Icon for transfers don't change when active
        v Send "smart" file size
        v Sort the list on time, group by id
    - Optimize the performance. We use too much CPU when receiving a file.
    - Send file
    - Implement stop_sending

  - Finish Contact List:
    - Send status, profile name/info/icon if we edit data
    - Show message icon if we have unread messages
    - Show connection status for contacts (not connecting, connecting, connected)

  - Chat window:
    - Show status similar to the contact list
    - Notifications regarding other events
    - Edit buddy button
    - Scroll down so we show the latest messages on arrival

  - Check if it works on Windows
  - Check if it works on OS/X
  - Check if it works on Android
  - Check if it works on IOS

  - Release beta!
