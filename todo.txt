BUGS:
  - Contact status not being updated when we go off-line
  - Contact Last seen not being updated
  - Contact status must show "offline" when he is offline
  - Edit data does not save the data
  - When a contact is edited, we must trigger an event in the contact-list so it gets updated
  - We don't get the profile info from the remote side in Edit dialog
  - We don't propagate client version
  - Messages queued when off-line is not sent.
