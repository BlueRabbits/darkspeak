    Work-flow:
      - Handle filedata. Set up a connection object fro the buddy,
        identified by the cookie. Notify the upper layer.
        >>  Only allow one pending file transfer per peer. Automatically
            dismiss a new request until the current one is approved or
            dismissed.
        >> Peers could have auto-accept, ask or auto-deny status on a buddy.
        >> Save incoming file-data in a temporary file in the peers download folder.
      - If the upper layer confirm the transfer, start sending OK packages.
    - Add File transfer view to list ongoing and complete file transfers
